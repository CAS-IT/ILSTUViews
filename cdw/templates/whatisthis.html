          <h4>What is 'ILSTU Views'?</h4>
          <p>ILSTU Views is an innovative social media tool developed by the American Democracy Project at Illinois State University and funded by a gift from State Farm. In short, ILSTU Views is a kind of digital soapbox for the 21st Century that provides a safe space for civil dialogue through interactive kiosks, a texting system, and a website. These three synchronized components create a single, seamless interactive experience for the broader Illinois State University community to actively engage in local, national and international issues.</p>
          <h5>ILSTU Views Kiosks:</h5>
          <p>The ILSTU Views kiosks contain touch-screen displays, which allow students, teachers and citizens to share ideas and solutions to pressing political and social questions facing the nation. Users post opinions or join existing debates on questions that deal with a range of relevant subjects varying from the environment to foreign policy. The first kiosk is installed in the lobby of Fell Hall on Illinois State.s campus and additional kiosks will be installed across campus over the next few years.</p>
          <h5>SMS:</h5>
          <p>ILSTU Views allows users to follow debates via SMS. Debaters are notified via text when another person joins the debate and can continue the discussion by texting back to ILSTU Views. ILSTU Views incorporates innovative technology to create curiosity, emulate the idea of conversing in a public space, and emphasize the critical component of using modern technology for communication.</p>
          <h5>The Website: (ilstuviews.illinoisstate.edu)</h5>
          <p>The website component of ILSTU Views closely mirrors the physical kiosk. The website is accessible to users who are not physically on campus. Providing the same features, the website gathers users from a broader population and allows users to keep track of debates.</p>
          <h5>Statistics:</h5>
          <p>The ILSTU Views software sifts through the key words of postings, tabulating them in dynamic data visualization to show where agreement lies. Collected information will be used by Illinois State.s American Democracy Project as well as users to locate common ground on potentially divisive topics.</p>
          <p>Help spread the word about ILSTU Views . and check back often to see the newest debates and opinions.</p>
